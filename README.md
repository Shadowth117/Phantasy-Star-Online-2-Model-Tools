DEPRECATED, please use this!: https://github.com/Shadowth117/Aqua-Toolset

Autodesk has caused various problems over the years, but the straw that broke the camel's back was making it unreasonable to acquire a legal non commercial version of their applications. At this point, I have no desire to further support their products. Anyways...



Scripts and programs for importing Phantasy Star Online 2 3d models to editing software.

While the maxscript was made by me with some "library" scripts and help from TGEnigma, the NIFL Tool originates from anonymous, open sources on the Japanese site 2chan. While unfortunately I have no way to source the individuals who started the program, I thank them for their work.
