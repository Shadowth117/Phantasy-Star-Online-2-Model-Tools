# Phantasy-Star-Online-2-Model-Tools
Scripts and programs for importing Phantasy Star Online 2 3d models to editing software.

While the maxscript was made by me with some "library" scripts and help from TGEnigma, the NIFL Tool originates from anonymous, open sources on the Japanese site 2chan. While unfortunately I have no way to source the individuals who started the program, I thank them for their work.
